    This tool shows the average GPA of courses and departments at the University
    of Maryland &mdash; College Park. The grade data includes all courses taught
    at UMD in the Fall and Spring from 2012 onwards. Semesters which were taught
    Pass / Fail are not included.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that average GPA is not a great metric for judging a course's
    difficulty. We believe students should not take a course based on which
    professor gives the highest grades. Of course, it is up to you; we do our
    best to provide the data to help you make an informed decision.
