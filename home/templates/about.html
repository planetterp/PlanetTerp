	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>PlanetTerp is a website designed to help students at the University of Maryland &mdash; College Park (UMD) make informed decisions. We provide a professor review system, grade data for courses and professors, and <a href="{% url 'tools' %}">various tools</a> which aggregate data about UMD and its courses. We hope that you find these features useful!</p>

	<h3>Goal</h3>
	<p>Our goal is to provide information that will help all students at UMD make informed decisions.</p>

	<h3>Review Criteria</h3>
	<p>While anyone is free to submit a review, anonymously or otherwise, all reviews are manually verified by us before being displayed on the site. Below are some common reasons reviews get rejected:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Vague negative comments with no elaboration. A review only saying "this professor sucks" would be rejected, for instance.</li>
		<li>Excessive hostility towards a professor. Negativity or criticism is fine, insults are not.</li>
		<li>Excessive use of caps lock. Don't make your review a nuisance for others to read, please!</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Review Accuracy</h3>
	<p>A common concern with professor review websites is that the reviews aren't necessarily accurate to real life, because a student with a negative experience is more likely to leave a review than a student with a positive experience. This may certainly be true, and you should take this into account when considering reviews.</p>

	<p>Additionally, be especially wary of trusting the rating of a professor with a low number of reviews.</p>

	<h3>Source Code</h3>

	<p>PlanetTerp is completely open source! Check out <a href="https://github.com/planetterp/planetterp">our github</a>. Contributions and/or feature requests are welcome.</p>

	<h3 id="credits">Credits</h3>
	<p>Professor and course information comes from a combination of the <a href="https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/">Schedule of Classes</a> and <a href="http://umd.io" target="_blank">umd.io</a>. Grade data is obtained from the <a href="https://www.irpa.umd.edu" target="_blank">IRPA</a> via a <a href="https://www.umd.edu/administration/public-information-request" target="_blank">PIA request</a>. Initial reviews were imported from OurUMD, and initial grade data was from <a href="https://vagrades.com" target="_blank">VA Grades</a>.</p>
