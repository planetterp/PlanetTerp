PlanetTerp is a website designed to help students at the University of Maryland â€” College Park (UMD) make informed decisions. We have a professor review system, grades for each course and professor, and tools to provide information related to UMD.

This is the second version of PlanetTerp. The first version was written in [web.py](https://github.com/webpy/webpy), and was closed source. It was rewritten in [django](https://github.com/django/django) at the beginning of 2022, which is the version you see here.

All contributions are welcome, whether that be opening an issue with a bug or feature request, or opening a pull request. See below for how to set up PlanetTerp locally.

### Setup

PlanetTerp is developed against python 3.9. It's likely that 3.7+ will work as well, but we only officially support 3.9+.

You'll also need to set up [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) if you haven't already. PlanetTerp is developed against MySQL 8.0, but any reasonably recent version should work.

Once you have MySQL, you'll need to create a database for PlanetTerp. This can be named anything, but you'll probably want to call it something like `planetterp`.

Note that when you create this database, you **must** select `utf8mb4` as the character set. The collation can be left as the default. The django code expects the database to have a character set of `utf8mb4`, and in particular the data import described below will fail if you create a database with the default character set (`latin1`).

Now we can start setting up PlanetTerp:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/planetterp/planetterp
cd planetterp
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp planetterp/config.py.example planetterp/config.py
```

At this point, you should open `planetterp/config.py` (not `planetterp/config.py.example`!). It should look something like this:

```python
DB_ENGINE = 'django.db.backends.mysql'
DB_NAME = 'planetterp'
DB_HOST = '127.0.0.1'
USER = 'root'
PASSWORD = ''
SECRET_KEY = 'django-insecure-zt7yxn++)bh)j#wzb)ofgd0^scu9rwr85%=3l%6g1zt(cx!t)_'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    "localhost",
    "127.0.0.1",
]

STATIC_ROOT = None
ADS_ENABLED = False
ADMINS = []
DEBUG = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = None
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = None
EMAIL_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS = None
WEBHOOK_URL_HELP = None
WEBHOOK_URL_UPDATE = None
WEBHOOK_FREQUENCY = 20
```

If you named your database something other than `planetterp`, you'll need to edit `DB_NAME`. If you would like to use a different user than `root` to access mysql, you'll need to edit `USER`, and if the password for your user is not the empty string, you'll need to edit `PASSWORD`.

The other fields can be left alone for now. We'll discuss the `WEBHOOK_*` and `EMAIL_*` settings in a bit, but they aren't necessary for an initial setup and can be left as `None`.

Once you're satisfied with your config, continue with your setup:

```bash
# this command will take a while to run because it imports some
# initial data.
python manage.py migrate
# courses which have been taught in the past 10 years are considered "recent".
# courses which are not recent are hidden from some displays like search
# and courses taught. Calculating whether a course is recent can be very
# expensive if done on the fly, so we cache it in a database column and require
# manual updates.
# If you skip this step, you site will appear as if it has no courses loaded,
# since recency defaults to false.
python manage.py updaterecency
```

To start the server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You'll probably want to create an admin user so that you can see the admin panel and other admin-only items. To do so, run `python manage.py createsuperuser`. You'll be able to log in using that user to your local planetterp site, and it will have admin permissions. Make sure you chose a password that's at least 8 characters long, or our client-side validation will reject it on the login page.

#### Advanced Setup

If you'd like to test features relating to the webhooks or emails, you'll need to fill in the relevant settings in `planetterp/config.py`. To be clear, you don't need to set this up if you don't want to. The site will still work fine, but no emails or webhook messages will be sent.

For webhooks, you can create a webhook url by going to a discord server (which you have the "Manage Webhooks" permission in), right clicking a channel, and selecting "integrations". Then click "Create Webhook" and then "Copy Webhook URL". That value is what you'll set the webhook url setting (either `WEBHOOK_URL_HELP` or `WEBHOOK_URL_UPDATE`) to.

For emails, you'll need to specify your email and password in `EMAIL_HOST_USER` and `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` respectively. Make sure to include the `@gmail` portion in `EMAIL_HOST_USER`. Feel free to create a burner gmail account for this purpose if you don't feel comfortable using your personal email address.

It's very likely that you'll also need to turn on "less secure app access" for your gmail account for email sending to work. This setting can be found under <https://myaccount.google.com/security> -> "Less secure app access".
